## Our dataset of choice for the next three weeks...

Half a year ago, the New York Times published an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/world/americas/mexican-militarys-high-kill-rate-raises-human-rights-fears.html?_r=1) detailing the "lethality" of Mexican armed forces in their fight against organized crime and drug cartels ongoing since 2006. Based on data that had been released by the Mexican Government until 2014, the article concludes that 

> Mexico’s armed forces are exceptionally efficient killers — stacking up bodies at extraordinary rates. [...] The Mexican Army kills eight enemies for every one it wounds. [...] For the nation’s elite marine forces, the discrepancy is even more pronounced: The data they provide says they kill roughly 30 combatants for each one they injure.

Last week, the [Drug Policy Program (PPD)](http://www.politicadedrogas.org/) at CIDE, a public university in Mexico, released a dataset that allegedly expands on a database that the Mexican government released with data on executions, confrontations, and aggressions presumably related to organized crime that happened between 2006-2010. 

PPD claims that a lengthier and more detailed database was leaked anonymously to the Program, and that it is allegedly the original database for the government dataset. This new data released by PPD spans 11 additional months to cover drom December 2006 to November 2011, roughly 80% of the Administration of then President Felipe Calder&oacute;n. According to PPD, it also includes new variables that were not previously available in the original government datatset. 

Based on this new data, PPD's director concludes that  

> 86.1% of dead civilians dead who presumably participated in confrontations with federal armed forces were killed in events of "perfect lethality" where there were only dead and no wounded. [...] Mexico has the terrible situation of having lethality indices of 2.6. The lethality index of the Federal Police is 2.6 dead for every wounded, the Navy's reaches 17.3 dead for eavery wounded, and the Army's is 9.1 dead for every wounded. 

We will be using this new behavioral dataset for the following three weeks and a couple of data challenges. Before class on 2/15:

* make sure you can run the munging script `Gather_ConfrontationsData_170209.R` and you understand what's going on
* read the data dictionary
* start exploring the dataset `ConfrontationsData_170209.csv`
* bring questions on the dataset if you have any (I'll be your sherpa on this one)

Data Challenge 1 (due on 2/22 at 6PM) will be posted *here* right before class on 2/15.
