This repository contains the materials for the course __Topics in Applied Data Science for Social Scientists__ taught in the Spring of 2017.

### Overview

In his now classic [Venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), Drew Conway described **Data Science** as sitting at
the intersection between **good hacking skills**, **math
  and statistics knowledge**, and **substantive expertise**. By
training, social scientists possess a fluid combination of all three,
but also bring an additional layer to the mix. We have acquired
slightly different training, skills and expertise tailored to
understand human behavior, and to explain why things happen
the way they do. Social scientists are, thus, a
particular kind of data scientist.


*This course is not intended to teach students how to code, create
  visualizations, or estimate models. It presumes you have learned
  that in other classes.* This course is intended to take students to the
  next level in becoming a data scientist. Therefore you will:
  
* learn current best practices in data science that will
  facilitate collaboration with data scientists trained in engineering
  or other hard sciences,
* learn soft skills that are key to a successful interaction with
  business stakeholders, and
* get exposed to data science practitioners and explore real-life
  applications from a social science perspective.

All of these are highly valued skills in the data science job market,
but seldom considered as part of an integral training for data
scientists.

**Prerequisites:** it is assumed that students have basic to
intermediate knowledge of [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/),
including experience using it for data manipulation, visualizations,
and model estimation. Some mathematics, statistics, econometrics and
algebra will also be assumed.


### Course Resources

these to be very useful resources for the course and later in your
careers:

### To actively participate on this course

By the second session, make sure to have the latest versions of
[__R__](https://www.r-project.org/), [__RStudio__](https://www.rstudio.com/), and
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer. Make sure also to
have cloned the class repository to your computer.
