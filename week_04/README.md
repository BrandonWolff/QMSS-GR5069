# Guest Speaker

Our guest for this week is [David Rothschild](http://researchdmr.com/), who is an economist at Microsoft Research, where he specializes in forecasting and public opinion and public sentiment. He is also one of the founders of [PredictWise](http://predictwise.com/), a "website for a project that studies the collection of individual-level data for predictions, aggregation of that data into prediction, and usage in predictions", per their own description.

You may want to skim through some of David's [most recent work](http://researchdmr.com/research/), including on [election forecasts](http://researchdmr.com/RothschildPOQ2009.pdf), non political forecasts such as the [Oscars](http://www.ubplj.org/index.php/jpm/article/view/1048), or the famous [mutilevel model] (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207014000879) used to forecast daily vote intention in the 2012 Presidential Election using XBox data.
