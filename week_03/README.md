# Required Readings

These three readings synthesize much of the current state of the art on what we know about forecasting:

* a [piece](/readings/Armstrong2001.pdf) by J. Scott Armstrong providing steps and principles to evaluate forecasts based on dense stack of academic research. 
* another [piece](/readings/Armstrong2012.pdf) by Armstrong on the differences between fitting models and generating forecasts
* make sure to skim through this [piece](readings/Armstrong_etal2015.pdf) by Armstrong and colleagues compiling principles that summarize current knowledge on forecasting 

# Complementary readings 




If you need a refresher on Time Series forecasting, you can start by reading this nice retrospect: [25 Years of Time Series Forecasting](http://dx.doi.org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2006.01.001). Also, make sure to look into [Forecasting: principles and practice](https://www.otexts.org/fpp) for an intro-level book-length reference, or  
[Time Series Analysis for the Social Sciences](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/research-methods-politics/time-series-analysis-social-sciences?format=PB&isbn=9780521691550) for a deeper book-length treatment. 

For a deeper dive on the theory underlying Time Series, consult [Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/econometric-analysis-cross-section-and-panel-data) or [Econometric Analysis](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/program/Greene-Econometric-Analysis-7th-Edition/PGM305107.html). 

An often referenced, but not always fully understood concept in time-series forecasting is it's decomposition. If curious, you'll profit from reading this [paper on STL](http://www.wessa.net/download/stl.pdf) which is a Loess-based decomposition method that is widely used today. There are other methods out there, but this would explain the mechanics with a much clarity.
